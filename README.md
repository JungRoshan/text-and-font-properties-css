# text-and-font-properties-css
 focused on text alignment, font styles, font weights, text decorations, and spacing properties.
This repository includes practice on advanced CSS text properties, including:

- **Text Alignment:** `text-align: center`, `end`, `right`
- **Font Properties:**  
  - `font-size` adjustment for headings and paragraphs  
  - `font-family` change to Impact, Calibri  
  - `font-weight` ranging from 100 to 700
- **Text Decoration:**  
  - Underline, overline, line-through with custom styles (`double`, `wavy`) and colors  
  - Removing underline from anchor tags (`text-decoration: none`)
- **Spacing:**  
  - `line-height` for controlling vertical spacing  
  - `letter-spacing` for adjusting space between letters

These exercises helped deepen my understanding of typography and layout styling in CSS.
